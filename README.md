# Isolate - Audio Source Separation

Isolate is a deep learning-based tool you can use to separate different audio sources in music (i.e guitar, vocals, drums, ...) from one another.

## About the Project

This project is being undertaken as a sample summer project by the Projects division of the McMaster Artificial Intelligence Society.

## Goal

The goal of the project is to create a command-line application which allows a user to submit an audio file and receive as output multiple files, one for each audio source.

This project is being undertaken to orientate the project leaders of the Mac AI Society with Scrum software development and our expected method for creating projects under the Mac AI Flag.
